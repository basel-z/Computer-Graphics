## Students Team data

Name: Basel Zarka

Name: Eli Abboud

### Lecturer
*Roi Poranne*


## Course Description

This course provides an introduction to the foundations of Computer Graphics. We will cover the basic mathematical concepts, such as 2D and 3D transformations, shading models, and rendering techniques. The ultimate goal of this course is to develop a basic model viewer.

Students will experiment with modern graphics programming and build a renderer using C++ and OpenGL.

By the end of the course, you will be able to:

* Explain and apply the fundamental mathematical concepts used in rendering.
* Implement a basic graphics pipeline based on rasterization.
* Develop simple graphics programs in C++ using OpenGL and GLSL.
